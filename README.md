# Zoku.io

__Zoku__ ([Êóè](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%97%8F)) is a Sino-Japanese term meaning tribe, clan, or family. (_[via Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoku)_)

As a suffix it has been used extensively within Japan to define subcultural phenomena, though many zoku do not acquire the suffix (e.g. cosplay).

__Zoko.io__ is a platform inspired by [The Jean le Flambeur Series](http://www.goodreads.com/series/57134-the-jean-le-flambeur-series) by [
Hannu Rajaniemi](http://www.amazon.com/Hannu-Rajaniemi/e/B003VNOJY6). It is not affiliated or related in any way with [zokuhome.com](http://www.zokuhome.com).

## Platform Principles

* Anyone can start a __Zoku__.
* A __Zoku__ can be for something small, fun or materially important.
* A person may be a member of many __Zoku__.
* Each __Zoku__ has members.
* The member(s) who create a __Zoku__ are founders.
* Each member has a level, starting at 1.
* Each member has a volition cone.
* A volition cone is the level of priority and influence on goal setting.
* A volition cone is determined based on a members level (entanglement).
* The larger the __Zoku__ the greater the volition cone applied to members vs. other __Zoku__.
* Members gain levels by gaining entanglement.
* The highest level achievable is an elder.
* Any members can create a goal.
* Goal setters decide if a goal was successful, sort-of successful, failed, etc.
* When a member contributes to a goal they are rewarded with entanglement.
* Entanglement rewarded is determined by the success of the goal itself.

A __Zoku__ will cause behavior of members to gravitate toward __Zoku__ goals over time through rewarding support of the __Zoku__ versus themselves.
